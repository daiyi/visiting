a game about memories and paper trails.

I started making this game as part of my first game jam, Berlin Mini Jam, but the idea has been in my head for a while. I was traveling with my sketchbook and missing my little sister, and I was feeling a soft sadness that I haven't been very present in her life since I moved out from the family house 7 years ago. This is how I imagine it might be to have an absent older sister.
